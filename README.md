Algorithms are from *Astronomical Algorithms* by Jean Meeus (2nd Edition. Published by Willmann-Bell, Inc.). Text files titled "earth##.txt" (e.g. "earthL0.txt," "earthR1.txt") are based off of their corresponding sections found in Appendix III of *Astronomical Algorithms* (which, in turn, cite French Planetary Theory VSOP87).
